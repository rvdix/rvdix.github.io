title: Macro Keypad Build
---

A friend the other day told me about a keypad that he wanted to use to setup macros for his Blender projects that he was working on. I told him that I would be able to build him one to his specifications if he wanted me to. He said that sounded go and so I went ahead with the build. 

For this build I was able to find someone who had already designed a [similar project](https://github.com/KikiHobbyRepair/Macro-Keyboard). After looking it over, I took to printing out the .STLs that were provided.
